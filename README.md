2- Modifiy the Ebay.php class and add new Method(s), objects and functions to intract with the endpoint from the link above.

3- Make sure to create public methods to allow other parts of the app to submit products to ebay and obey Required & optional fields.

The Ebay.php class has examples of methods how it should like.
